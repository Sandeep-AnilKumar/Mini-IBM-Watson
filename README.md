# Mini-IBM-Watson

##Description

We have tried to build a Mini IBM Watson. This was a project which me and User:- "Pavuu" worked on. We have used Stanford's CoreNLP Library and parsed questions and answered questions like:-
Which domain does a question belong to?

For the next part of the project we will be working on answering the questions like "Who won the Oscar for Best Actor in the year 2016?".
And the program should return "Leonardo Di Caprio."

We are using SQLite Database which consists of data on 3 domains:- Movies, Music and Geography.

If you have any clarifications please contact us.
